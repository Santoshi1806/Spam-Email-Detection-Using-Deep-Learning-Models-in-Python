# 🔍 **Project Highlights:**

🧠 Utilized **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **LSTM models** to understand and classify email text.
🧾 Performed **data preprocessing**, including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization using **TF-IDF** and **Word Embeddings**.
⚙️ Implemented the model in **Python 🐍** using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Scikit-learn** frameworks.
📈 Evaluated model performance with metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**.
🎯 The model achieved strong results in distinguishing **spam vs. ham (non-spam)** messages.
